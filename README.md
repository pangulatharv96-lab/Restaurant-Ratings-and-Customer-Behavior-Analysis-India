# Restaurant-Ratings-and-Customer-Behavior-Analysis-India
Project Overview 
The project is an end-to-end data analytics tool developed based on authentic restaurant and 
customer data obtained from the Google Kaggle site. The purpose of this project was to study 
the nature of customer and rating information, and make this information meaningful. The 
project focused on analyzing various characteristics of customers and rating systems in Indian 
cities. 
The entire process undertaken includes data acquisition, processing, storage, analysis, and 
visualization using Python, MySQL, and Power BI. Therefore, the project described here 
represents an impressive application of skills for data analytics.
